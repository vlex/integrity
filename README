Integrity â€” Continuous Integration server

Compared with http://github.com/integrity/integrity this fork has four major enhancements:

- The output is wider, occupying 90% of the page rather than just 40em

- The elapsed time for each build is shown in the list of builds

- The output of the build process is shown in real time, rather than only at the end of each build

- Optional screenshots taking during the test are shown within each build
